# savebase64tofile
It is a demonstration of saving an base64 image into file from js itself. But for demonstration purpose, i am generating base64 image too from browser.

Since i used symlinked js, it's not uploaded here.

So kindly download it from

http://github.com/eligrey/Blob.js

http://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/

http://github.com/apitts/canvas-toBlob.js

http://github.com/jquery/jquery

Or Ideally, if you are familiar with bower
Just install 


bower install


Then use some thing like

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9090

to serve this files. I couldn't get working with just opening the file.
